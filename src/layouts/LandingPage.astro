				<p>
					I am a software engineer with a passion for building
					products that make a difference. I have experience in
					full-stack development, with a focus on front-end
					technologies. I am currently working at a startup in Tel
					Aviv, where I am responsible for building and maintaining
					the company's web application.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow
					as a developer. I am excited to work on projects that
					challenge me and allow me to use my skills to create
					something meaningful.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking, and spending time
					with my family. I am also an avid traveler and love
					exploring new places and cultures.
